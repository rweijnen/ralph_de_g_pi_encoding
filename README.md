Last night I was watching the Dutch TV show "Hunters" (S05E06 which can be found online [here](https://www.avrotros.nl/hunted/gemist/detail/item/hunted-s5-afl-6-30-11-2020/) and I noticed that one of the participants received an encrypted or encoding text message from a friend:

I thought it would be fun to decode/decipher it
